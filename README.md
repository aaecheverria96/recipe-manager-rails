# Rails Recipe Manager Project 

# Goal 
Create a Recipe Manager application that allows users to create, edit and share their own food recipes. Users can only delete and edit their own recipes. Also once they create a recipe it is immediately affiliated with that specific user. A user should be able to log in with their google account also.
